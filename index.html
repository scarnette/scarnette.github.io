      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer currently working as a Salesforce Admin at
        <a href="https://www.eastman.com/Pages/Home.aspx">Eastman</a>. I graduated
        in 2018 from NC State University with my BS in Computer Science and a
        minor in Cognitive Science. At NC State I was an Engineering Ambassador,
        as well as the Vice President for our chapter of ACM/AITP.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving complex problems with technical solutions and am currently
        searching for the perfect side project to work on outside of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I like to try new recipes in the kitchen, listen to podcasts,
        or curl up with a good book and a hot cup of coffee.

      <h2>salesforce</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, I currently work as a Salesforce Admin, and I absolutely
        love it! The unique part of my job is that we are a completely out of the box
        Salesforce shop. We have absolutely <b>no</b> customizations in our Salesforce
        org. One of my first projects was actually removing the only customization we had
        and developing it with configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a completely out of the box Salesforce org presents a unique challenge.
        My team and I often have to come up with unique solutions in order to complete
        a business requirement. Let's just say I know Process Builders and Flows forwards
        and backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working on my Admin certification (yay!) but you can view my
        Trailhead profile <a href="https://trailhead.com/me/sarnette">here</a>.

      <h2>what's next?</h2>
      <p>
        As I'm really new in my career, I don't have much else to put on here. I'm
        currently searching for a good side programming project to work on in my spare
        time, and I'd also like to start a blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next big *career* move is getting my Salesforce Admin certification, which
        I will do before the end of 2019.
